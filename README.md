This is a site or webapp that utilizes the API here for sports records queries: 
http://sportsdatabase.com/api 

You can enter your own queries to return the same results like you see here or pulls in the results or links to the results page: https://tinyurl.com/Sdqlexample

Then you save any queries you like with a description you type. They would be saved in a numbered list, grouped by sport/league such as MLB,NFL,NCAAF, WNBA, etc.

The page will show all active game in a query 

MLB: 3 queries
NFL: 15 queries
CFL: None
NCAAF: 19 queries

If I clicked the first one for MLB 3 queries, it would take me to a list of those 3 active queries. I could then click on any of the 3 to run them and see the results. You can see examples of what I'm looking for in thid hes part: http://b2b.sportsdatabase.com/mlb/trends and here: http://b2b.sportsdatabase.com/nfl/trends
